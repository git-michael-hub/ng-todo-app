ðŸš€ Direct Function Import
âœ… When to Use:

The function is a pure function (stateless, no dependencies).
The function does not rely on Angular DI (e.g., utility functions).
Performance is a priority (avoids Angular's DI overhead).




ðŸ”¹ Using Dependency Injection (DI)
âœ… When to Use:

The function depends on Angular services (e.g., HTTP requests, state management).
The function should be mockable for unit testing.
The function has side effects (e.g., logging, analytics, HTTP calls).
